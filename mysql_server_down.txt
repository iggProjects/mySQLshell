  IMPORTANT: do NOT delete ibdata1 file. You could destroy all your databases.

  Instead, first try using the MySQL backup folder which is included with XAMPP. So do next steps:

  Rename folder mysql/data to mysql/data_old
  Make a copy of mysql/backup folder and name it as mysql/data
  Copy all your database folders from mysql/data_old into mysql/data (except mysql, performance_schema, and phpmyadmin folders)
  Copy mysql/data_old/ibdata1 file into mysql/data folder
  Start MySQL from XAMPP control panel

# Backup old data
Rename-Item -Path "./data" -NewName "./data_old"

# Create new data directory
Copy-Item -Path "./backup" -Destination "./data" -Recurse
Remove-Item "./data/test" -Recurse
$dbPaths = Get-ChildItem -Path "./data_old" -Exclude ('mysql', 'performance_schema', 'phpmyadmin') -Recurse -Directory
Copy-Item -Path $dbPaths.FullName -Destination "./data" -Recurse
Copy-Item -Path "./data_old/ibdata1" -Destination "./data/ibdata1"
